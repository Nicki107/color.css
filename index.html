Candied yams is one of my favorite homecooked meals. It reminds me of a cool winter night with a warm hardy meal. The flavors of the candied yams fresh out of the oven are delicious. As a child, I watched my grandmother in the kitcken making this same receipe and taste tasting for her. Now I carry on the tradition with my family.
